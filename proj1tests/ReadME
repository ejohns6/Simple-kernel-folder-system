SingleMailBoxTests test for all the syscalls in both encryption and decyrption,
with multiple variations on send, recv, and peek to try to catch specific cases.

MultipleBoxTest is for test when multiple boxes for create and remv. During my
debugging i was able to mix it up and try it with multiple messages to a mail
box that was no the head.

As of right now the code passes for everything and I am leaving the printk outputs
so if/when it crashes the grader can have a better understanding why and 
might able to leave a comment.
